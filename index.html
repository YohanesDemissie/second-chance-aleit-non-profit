      <h2>MISSION STATEMENT</h2>
      <p calss="part-b-text">“The 2nd Chance Aleit Nonprofit aims to combat systemic barriers for ex-offenders, single parents and minorities by providing them access to higher education“</p>
      
      <h2>(PART C)</h2>
      <p class="part-c-text">“The 2nd Chance Aleit Nonprofit was created out of the mission to provide economic opportunities for disenfranchised groups. This nonprofit is created to tackle three objectives. 1. Provide ex-offenders the opportunity to pursue educational training that could provide them the opportunity to start over. 2. To grant single parents the economic support to pursue educational paths without putting stress on the family. 3. Assist Low-income BIPOC opportunities to overcome economic difficulties to pursue a college education. “ ----->>> (CAN DELETE THIS PARAGRAPH AND JUST KEEP SPECIFIC TARGETS BELOW, IF TOO MUCH!!!)</p>
      <b>“The specific targets and purpose of this organization shall be:</b>
      <b>A) Ex-Offender:</b><p> Over the years we have seen the unfair justice system that creates a system of recidivism of ex-offenders. The lack of support in the judicial system has created a cycle of recidivism within our culture. To help stop this travesty, The 2nd Chance Aleit Nonprofit plans to provide funding for those in need of higher education.</p>
      <b>B) Single Parents:</b><p> Our communities come from single family households. This has created economic hardships for our families to pursue higher education. This is why The 2nd Chance Aleit Nonprofit, is funding single parents that want to advance their lives through higher education.</p>
      <b>C) Low-income BIPOC</b><p>The current system we live in, has created many barriers for low-income BIPOC to get ahead. At The 2nd Chance Aleit Nonprofit, we plan to create a path in which communities of color can flourish and thrive. We want to create a culture of acceptance and growth. “</p>
